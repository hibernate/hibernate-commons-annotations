 * A typing context that knows how to "resolve" the generic parameters of a

 * For example:
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <blockquote>
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 *  class Shop&ltT&gt{
 *    List&ltT&gt getCatalog() { ... }
 *  }
 * <p/>
 *  class Bakery extends Shop&ltBread&gt{}
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * </blockquote>
 * <p/>
 * Consider the type returned by method <code>getCatalog()</code>. There are
 * two possible contexts here. In the context of <code>Shop</code>, the type
 * is <code>List&ltT&gt</code>. In the context of <code>Bakery</code>, the
 * type is <code>List&ltBread&gt</code>. Each of these contexts can be
 * represented by a <code>TypeEnvironment</code>.
